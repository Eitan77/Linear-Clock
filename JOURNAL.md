Total Time Spent: >25 hours, with a LOT more to come once I can assemble, code, test, and revise. The optimization of the design and the UI is what I think will take the most time on this project. 

Dates: I started this project on the first of June, and I hope to assemble it as soon as I can get the parts! 

Time Spent Per Day: I have spent around an hour to two hours per day, on as many days of the week as I can manage. 

As of 7/1, I am working on a PCB mounting bracket. I am trying to make the PCB as small as possible to save on production costs, so instead of making a PCB that takes up the whole face of the clock, I am making it smaller and then holding it in place with a 3D printed bracket. I might split it in half later and have 2 separate PCBs to save on shipping costs.
