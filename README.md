Hello, this is my first major project: The Progress Bar Clock 
It consists of 124 individual LEDs that light up in sequence, marking the progress of your day as time passes, kinda like a video game loading screen, but in real life. 
Each second, a second LED will light up, and so on until a minute has passed, at which time the seconds bar resets and one of the minute LEDs lights up. Same thing for the hours and so on. 
I feel like sometimes I let the day slip by me, and so I wanted to create something that can provide me a vivid representation of the time passing, and that serves as a cool decorative piece. 

The clock has 124 WS2812-V5 LEDs for the progress bar segments, 4 buttons to control the settings on the clock, and a USB Type-C connection port, all connected via a custom PCB and controlled by an Arduino Nano. 
It is in a 3D printed enclosure, with an acrylic front panel, light guide, and diffuser. There is no other wiring besides the PCB, and the power to the PCB is connected to a USB breakout with a switch.
